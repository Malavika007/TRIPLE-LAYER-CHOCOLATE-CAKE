This is my favorite homemade chocolate cake recipe. 
With a super moist crumb and fudgy, yet light texture, 
this chocolate cake recipe will be your favorite too.
 Top with chocolate buttercream and chocolate chips for 
 3x the chocolate flavor. You can also prepare this 
 chocolate layer cake as a sheet cake too. See recipe note.
